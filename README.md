# PySpark Google Play Store Analysis

This project explores the Google Play Store Apps dataset from Kaggle using PySpark, particularly focusing on **SparkSQL** and **DataFrames** for analysis.

The key processes and techniques involved include:
- **Data Wrangling**: Converting data types and performing data cleaning using regular expressions.
- Loading data from a **CSV** file that includes escape characters.
- Identifying and removing **duplicate** entries to ensure data quality.
- Writing and executing SQL-like queries using **SparkSQL** for data analysis.
- Converting **Spark** DataFrames into **Pandas** DataFrames for visualization, utilizing Pandas built-in plotting tools.
